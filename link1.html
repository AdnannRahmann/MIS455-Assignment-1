            <h3>The Birthplace of Islam and Ancient Trade Center.</h3>
            Over the centuries, the Saudi Peninsula has played a crucial role in world history. It is the birthplace of Islam, where the Prophet Muhammad received his revelations in the city of Mecca. Additionally, Saudi Arabia served as an ancient trade center, connecting various civilizations through the lucrative trade routes that crisscrossed the Arabian Peninsula.

            Transformation from Desert to Modern State
            After the discovery of oil, Saudi Arabia underwent a remarkable transformation. From a desert country, it evolved into a modern and sophisticated state that plays a vital role on the global stage. Here are some intriguing facts:

            Young Prince in Charge: Since King Salman ascended to the throne in 2015, his 30-year-old son, Prince Mohammed bin Salman, gained unrivaled power. He serves as crown prince, minister of defense, and deputy prime minister, overseeing security and economic development.
            Richest Royal Family: The Saudi royal family is the richest in the world, with a net worth estimated at around $100 billion. Their wealth primarily comes from Saudi Arabia’s vast oil reserves, valued at approximately $2 trillion.
            Luxurious Lifestyle: Leading the pack is Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, who purchased a $450 million DaVinci painting, a French chateau for $300 million, and a $500 million yacht.
            Global Influence: Forbes Magazine ranked Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman as the 8th most powerful person in the world. His influence extends beyond Saudi Arabia’s borders.
            Tragic Story of Princess Mishaal: The Saudi royal family spent $500 million trying to suppress the release of a documentary about the execution of Princess Mishaal. She was killed due to sexual misconduct after falling in love with another man following her divorce.
            Over 7,000 Princes: The Saudi royal family includes over 7,000 princes, all given prestigious roles. However, this practice sometimes blocks other qualified Saudis from obtaining great jobs.
            Father of the Saudi Nation: King Ibn Saud, the first king of Saudi Arabia, crowned himself in 1932 after declaring independence. He had 17 wives, 44 known sons, and an unknown number of daughters.
            Nation Named After Ibn Saud: He is one of the few people in world history to have a nation named after himself—Saudi Arabia.
            Knighted by Queen Elizabeth: In 1935, Ibn Saud was knighted by Queen Elizabeth of England for his role in establishing the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
            Education Abroad: Sattam bin Abdul Aziz, Ibn Saud’s son, was the first to earn an American university degree.

             <h3>Makkah-The Sacred City of Islam</h3>
        <p>
            
            Makkah (also spelled Mecca) holds immense significance for Muslims worldwide. It is the most sacred city and the birthplace of the Prophet Muhammad. While its rich heritage and historic importance are well known, Makkah also harbors lesser-known surprises. Here are some intriguing facts that shed light on this beloved city:
            
            Oldest Inhabited City:
            Makkah is reputed to be the oldest continuously inhabited city in the world. Its ancient roots stretch back through millennia, making it a living testament to human history.
            The World’s Most Expensive Building:
            Al-Masjid Al-Haram, the Grand Mosque in Makkah, holds a special place in the hearts of Muslims. Interestingly, it was listed by The Telegraph as the world’s most expensive building.
            The construction cost of this magnificent mosque is an astounding $100 billion.
            Highest Prayer Room on Earth:
            Did you know that Makkah is home to the tallest prayer hall? Situated 600 meters above sea level in the Makkah Clock Royal Tower Hotel, this prayer room can accommodate up to six people.
            Imagine praying with a breathtaking view of the holy city!
            Ancient Zamzam Well:
            The Zamzam well, located within the precincts of Al-Masjid Al-Haram, is believed to be around 4,000 years old.
            Pilgrims still drink from its sacred waters, connecting to a tradition that spans centuries.
            The Journey of the Black Stone:
            The iconic Black Stone (Hajar al-Aswad) embedded in the Kaaba has a fascinating history.
            In 930 AD, it was stolen by the Qarmatians, who took it to Eastern Arabia. Eventually, it was returned to Makkah.
            Beyond Al-Haram Boundaries:
            While Al-Haram Al-Sharif (the sacred mosque area) encompasses much of Makkah, there are areas outside its boundaries.
            For example, the neighborhood of Sharaya lies beyond the confines of Al-Haram.
            Not the Capital, but Always Revered:
            Although Makkah was never the capital of any Islamic empire, it received continued maintenance from various Muslim rulers.
            Its sacred status transcends political considerations.
            Symbolic Usage of “Mecca”:
            In popular English usage, the term “Mecca” refers to any place that draws large numbers of people.
            Makkah’s city center, where Masjid Al-Haram stands, is at a lower elevation than the rest of the city, making it prone to flash floods in the past.
            Prophet Muhammad’s Connection:
            While Madinah is commonly known as the “City of the Prophet,” our beloved Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) spent approximately 50 years of his life in Makkah.
            His early life, prophethood, and struggles unfolded within the sacred precincts of this city.
            Evolution of Al-Kaaba:
            Al-Kaaba, the central cubic structure in Masjid Al-Haram, has undergone changes over time.
            It once had two doors (one for entering and one for exiting) and even a window. However, the modern structure now features only one door and no windows.
            Additionally, Al-Kaaba was not always covered in its current black and gold kiswa cloth; it was adorned with various colored coverings, including red.
            Makkah is a city steeped in remarkable history, traditions, and spirituality. With affordable Umrah packages, everyone can have the opportunity to delve into these fascinating insights. Book your Umrah journey today and let us take you there!
