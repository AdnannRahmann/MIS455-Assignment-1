    Since the mid-20th century, the Middle East has been a hotspot of volatility. It involves conflicts among disparate rivals, regional and global powers. Israel has engaged in wars and faced threats from militias like Hamas and Hezbollah. These conflicts have led to widespread instability and violenceÂ¹. The region's history dates back to ancient civilizations and continues through major empires to today's nation-states. The Middle East spans from the Mediterranean Sea to the Persian Gulf, encompassing arid regions in Southwest Asia and part of North Africa.

   <p>The Middle East is a culturally, politically, and economically diverse region that extends for some 5,000 miles (8,000 kilometers) from west to east and approximately 2,000 miles (3,200 kilometers) from north to south. Here are some key points about the Middle East:

    1. Geographical Scope:
       - The Middle East encompasses lands around the southern and eastern shores of the Mediterranean Sea.
       - It includes at least the Arabian Peninsula and, by some definitions, parts of Iran and North Africa.
       - The central part of this area was formerly known as the Near East.
    
    2. Historical Classification:
       - Early Western geographers and historians divided the Orient into three regions:
         - Near East: The region nearest Europe, extending from the Mediterranean Sea to the Persian Gulf.
         - Middle East: From the Persian Gulf to Southeast Asia.
         - Far East: Referring to regions facing the Pacific Ocean.
       - The usage of these terms evolved prior to World War II, and the term "Middle East" gained prominence during the war when it was used by the British military command in Egypt.
    
    3. Common Definition:
       - By the mid-20th century, a common definition of the Middle East included the following states or territories:
         - Turkey, Cyprus, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Iran, Israel, the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, Jordan, Egypt, Sudan, Libya, and various states and territories of Arabia (e.g., Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Yemen, Oman, Bahrain, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates).
       - Over time, the definition has expanded to include additional lands.
    
    4. North African Connection:
       - The three North African countries of Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco are closely connected in sentiment and foreign policy with the Arab states.
    
    5. Other Considerations:
       - Geographic factors often require statesmen to take account of Afghanistan and Pakistan in connection with Middle Eastern affairs.
       - Occasionally, **Greece** is included in the compass of the Middle East due to historical events related to the Ottoman Empire.
